Blocks the distracting cruft from the otherwise-excellent Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange network. The idea for the extension came about as I started my first job as a web developer and, subsequently, came to spend more and more of my day scanning Stack Overflow, Server Fault, Ask Ubuntu, and so on. I became increasingly distracted by the sidebar links, which may have had to do with all of the coffee I drink.
