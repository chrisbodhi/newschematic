<h5>I made a thing. It started out as an assignment and a learning experience, using JavaScript for the whole stack. Then I learned that it was taking too long. Thus, a classic Ruby on Rails application with some AJAX-y goodness thrown in. Perhaps my favorite features are the differentiation between to-do items and those overdue; and the inclusion of Action Mailer to send a daily agenda.</h5>
