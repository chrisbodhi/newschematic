Some parting thoughts for this year's list of books finished: lots more comics this year. Marvel monthlies were straight-up popcorn (tasting more and more stale),
the Conan works were much more sophisticated than I expected, and King & Gerads slay. Two audiobooks ðŸ‘‚ and two re-reads âž°. I didn't track the dozens of board
books I've read to our now-toddler, but I could recite most of them from memory.

Looking at how I rated the books I read, I see that there's a lot of fluff and missing substance. Not the worst, but with less and less time to read, I may
have to be more deliberate about what I'm reading to make the most of it.
