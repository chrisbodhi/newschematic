<p>Day 3 at MakerSquare.</p>
<p>A pun-y morning with wireframing and CSS layout. Looking back at the web design I&rsquo;ve done in the past [which involved a vicious amount of Googling about &lt;div&gt; and floats and inline-blocks], I&rsquo;m excited about developing the skillz to quickly iterate on designs I&rsquo;ve sketched out. No more sweating over how the introduction of a new paragraph could break the layout.</p>
<p><span>They say that by suffering with manual CSS layout, we will develop a greater appreciation for frameworks. Without having touched a single one of them, I can confirm that yes, frameworks are awesome. </span></p>
<p>Heard another reappropriated phrase from the pre-internet days: &ldquo;above the fold&rdquo; once referenced the top half of the front page of a newspaper, the part that passersby would see at newsstands and in newspaper boxes. Now, it references the section of the page that&rsquo;s immediately visible in the browser window when first loading a page. </p>
<p><span>For back-end development, it was all Ruby projects. First up, a choose-your-own-adventure <a href="https://github.com/chrisbodhi/cya_day_3" target="_blank">text game</a> that&rsquo;s a thinly-veiled parable about life choices. Then, lots of math fun with questions from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> and answers <a href="https://github.com/chrisbodhi/euler-maths" target="_blank">stowed away on GitHub</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Conquerors: dead laptop battery, snooze button not leaving enough time for a workout</span></p>
<p><span>Conquered: 37 degree bicycle ride, a very vocal error with the git extension in Sublime Text, finding the largest product of five numbers in a string 1,000 digits long</span></p>
