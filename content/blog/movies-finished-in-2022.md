_† denotes a re-watch_

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

55 movies finished last year, down from 81 in 12021; 21 of these were re-viewings (not counted&mdash;any number of children's films I could recite from memory in their entirety). Percentage of rewatches is down slightly, though, from 43% to 38%.

At the end of [the last review](https://newschematic.org/blog/movies-finished-in-2021/), I wrote,

>I'll have to do a better job of veering towards _unforgettable_, for either good or bad reasons.

Do I think I did better at this? Not really! Am I ok with that? Yes! I'm not really in a space to push myself with my limited viewing time, but that's just the situation for now, and not forever.
For instance, _Venom: Let There Be Carnage_ will be memorable because it was the first movie I watched while holding my newborn son, a scant three days old. I started _A Touch of Sin_ on paternity
leave, but didn't finish it for months; certainly, a lot of the impact was lost with that break. And as far as impact is concerned, _The Green Knight_ probably had the most emotional jolt, but I found
even that wore off after a few days. Regression to the mean is a powerful force that may not be as impacted by events as much as we think, but by the consistent application of force that may flow
from those events.
