<p>It’s strictly an 8-to-5 kind of place — there are late nights, but they’re the exception. The programmers are intense, but low-key. Many of them have put in years of work either for IBM (which owned the shuttle group until 1994), or directly on the shuttle software. They’re adults, with spouses and kids and lives beyond their remarkable software program.</p>

<p>That’s the culture: the on-board shuttle group produces grown-up software, and the way they do it is by being grown-ups. It may not be sexy, it may not be a coding ego-trip — but it is the future of software. When you’re ready to take the next step — when you have to write perfect software instead of software that’s just good enough — then it’s time to grow up.</p><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff" target="_blank">They Write the Right Stuff | Fast Company | Business + Innovation</a> (via <a href="http://tumblr.iamdanw.com/" class="tumblr_blog" target="_blank">iamdanw</a>)
