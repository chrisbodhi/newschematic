<p>Day 9 of MakerSquare.</p>
<p>Back-end: more work with Rspec. Asked more questions today and got a better handle on the process. Diagramming the example code helped, as usual. A side benefit to this program is the opportunity to deeply examine how I best learn. Ammunition for the future.</p>
<p>Front-end: more functions in JavaScript with an assist from jQuery. Also better than yesterday. I have developed some sort of value judgment against JS, which means I need to spend more time with it. Preferably while drinking less java.</p>
<p>After class, another speaker from Datafiniti, Osei Bonsu, came by to demonstrate JS debugging with Chrome’s developer tools. Though my battery-less machine prevented me from following along, his energy and enthusiasm were contagious. I hope he comes back again later when we have some more experience with the language under our belts.</p>
<p>Conqueror: laptop plugged in away from presentation area, evening drivers failing to yield</p>
<p>Conquered: morning drivers yielding all over the place, reading the Stoics, slowly gathering resources for side project (hahahaha!)</p>
