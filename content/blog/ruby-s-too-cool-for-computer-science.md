<p>Day 25 at MakerSquare.</p>
<p>Front-end: started mucking around with MVP - model, views, presenters - with our host of JS libraries. Conceptually, it seems similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen in Rails. I think the next step to take will be getting a better understanding of the file structure and where to store what code.Â </p>
<p>Back-end: sending emails with Rails Action Mailer. It was interesting to see how this system used the MCV style of Rails to incorporate with the rest of the application. Also, there&rsquo;s something really awesome about reaching into the world from one of our applications and interacting with some aspect of it.</p>
<p>Later: first presentation by one of the cohort members, Mateo. He gave us a rundown on the Instagram API, even making us a tutorial that&rsquo;s on his Github account [<a href="https://github.com/mateoclarke/InstagramAPI-tutorial" target="_blank">here, by the way</a>]. Squashed bugs with my mentor, Justin, after that. It&rsquo;s good to have a second pair of eyes on a project.</p>
