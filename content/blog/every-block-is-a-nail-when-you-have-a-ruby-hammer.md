<p>Day 7 at MakerSquare.</p>
<p>Back-end: Algorithms demystified. Got into the nitty and/or gritty of the Great Hash Versus Array Quandry. There&rsquo;s the balance to strike between what&rsquo;s best for the computer [which really is about the user] and what&rsquo;s easiest to write. Ruby was created with the user [read: programmer] in mind; I wonder where the other trade-offs will be.</p>
<p>Spent too long drawing diagrams and writing pseudo-code to solve an aspect of an extra credit problem that wasn&rsquo;t actually requested. Ha. Takeaway: Beware the trap of walking around with my Ruby-hammer, looking for the question-nails.</p>
<p>Front-end: Javascript. Hit a good stride with my pair, but once I started working individually, there was&hellip;some stumbling. This sort of self-assessment, though, is invaluable. I imagine that some of this hilarity has to do with switching gears in the middle of the day. But, hey, it&rsquo;s the name of the game.</p>
<p>After class, Albert Swantner came by to give a break-neck presentation on Git. Afterward, he fielded questions all about anything, which I think has been the best Q and A here to date. [This opinion was not at all influenced by the awesome notebooks he brought.] Thinking back on the talk and the challenges he mentioned related to raising money here [versus Silicon Valley], I&rsquo;m glad to hear that there isn&rsquo;t the same attitude here as in other centers of outrageous wealth. I like to think that the tech scene in Austin is more grounded in reality, as opposed to an obsession with building the next #{hot_startup_with_an_IPO}.</p>
<p>Homework: I updated the version of Ruby that Sublime Text 2 uses in its build system. Why is it so exciting to hone my tools and personalize them?</p>
<p>Conquerors: the length of these things, setting a variable to zero in a loop when I want to be counting it, accidentally bringing up the terminal with my cool-d00d hotkey</p>
<p>Conquered: working on Ruby at 7 am with a fresh cup of coffee, green lights in the morning, sitting in the sun at lunch, asking questions to presenters</p>
