<p>Day 29 of MakerSquare. </p>

<p>Front-end: more jQuery and then digging into Presenters for riot.js. We continued to build our app that allows for posting and commenting on pictures of animals. Our directive today was to study changes in the code and then add a feature to tally the total &ldquo;likes&rdquo; on comments for a specific picture. </p>

<p>Back-end: Helpers of all sorts in Rails. Partials for the views and helper methods to take &ldquo;the business logic&rdquo; out of the views and into model helpers. Glad I completed the Hartl tutorial over the break because: seeing things a second time helps with learning, and I have a new appreciation for Haml, which we used today.</p>
