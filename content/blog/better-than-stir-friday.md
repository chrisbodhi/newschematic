<p>Day 5 at MakerSquare.</p>
<p>Friday is Tie Day. &amp; also project day.</p>
<p>Front-end: Pick a website and redesign it. I had originally picked the site for my favorite diner in town, <a href="http://kerbeylanecafe.com" target="_blank">Kerbey Lane</a>. Excellent pancakes, cluttered website. It was correctly suggested that the scope of that redesign would be too much. I then picked another local institution, <a href="http://austinbooks.com" target="_blank">Austin Books &amp; Comics</a>. I started by sketching out some mockups and jumped in.</p>
<p>No good. No good at all. </p>
<p>Once the design started to come together, I realized it looked like a generic Wordpress theme. Project Day has now turned into Project Weekend.</p>
<p>Back-end: The standard library project: adds books, add patrons, let them check out books. Classes, instances, variables of varying scope are all making sense. Once I cracked the code on the first method, the rest fell into place. Well, mostly: I spent way too long thinking I had written an assignment with a single equals sign, when in reality, the code was trying to perform an equality check with a double equals sign.</p>
<p>Hilarity.</p>
<p>The last issue involved an unnecessary loop, which printed an array twice: first with Item #1, then with Item #1 and Item #2. It took three pairs of eyes to find it, but it was an excellent example of minimizing code to lower chances of bugs. Now, it&rsquo;s an exercise in some<a href="http://tomdoc.org/" target="_blank"> serious code documentation</a>.</p>
