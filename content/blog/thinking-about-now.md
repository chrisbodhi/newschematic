After moving to a new state recently, I've started collecting my [now](/now) thoughts on the go. I limited each category to one tactical task to complete, just one, but found myself overwhelmed by all of the different tasks that still loomed large.

Ordered only by happenstance:

<blockquote>
- Community: Clean up that sidewalk 
- Vets: GBF monthly donation
- Abe: better with people coming over
- Oscar: potty training
- New babe: infant CPR classes
- Long term crazy: skyhook
- Work: finishing ACL
- Wife: more cooking
- Fitness: Simple standard
- Nutrition: more protein
- Water: 100 oz
- House: hang mail basket and then stack washer/dryer and then soil testing
- Health: clear up sinus infection then ankle rehab/practice
- Rowdy: rain cover 
</blockquote>

This isn't a small list, and I like to use my now as a way of focusing on just the next step, just on what can be done now, and what _must_ be done now.

But, this list isn't that. Some of it consists of goals. Some of it is fuzzy and not really specified in terms of a practice or even a desired endstate. It's really just a list of things that were floating around my head, and have made it onto a list in front of me. Maybe that's good enough for now.
