<p>Day 17 at MakerSquare. </p>
<p>I had some sort of idea for a title on the bike ride to MKS this morning, but it was lost. Pretty sure it was brilliant and insightful. </p>
<p>Rails week continues:</p>
<ul><li><span>Using Active Records to associate tables in the morning: tables talking to each other!</span></li>
<li><span>Test-driven Rails development in the afternoon: red to green with Rails!</span></li>
<li><span>Surprise visit from the folks at Ordoro: they brought us burritos and now rank among the greatest people in the world.</span></li>
<li><span>Started to plan the co-authoring of documentation for a Ruby gem we used in class last week. But, that will have to come later: our first hackathon starts Friday afternoon. </span></li>
</ul><p>It&rsquo;ll probably be wise to go over my Ruby and Javascript notes tomorrow, and healthy to go over the yoga moves I practiced today, ahead of the <strike>madness</strike> good times of the coming weekend. </p>
