<p>Day 16 of MakerSquare.</p>
<p>More Rails today - are you detecting a theme? Got into the nitty-gritty of CRUD - Create Read Update Delete - systems. We mimicked nearly the entire development history of Web 2.0 over the course of a day. </p>
<p>The program has been evolving, as well. We started taking daily progress exams at the end of the lessons. The gut reaction to &lsquo;exam&rsquo; is always one of apprehension and resistance, but aren&rsquo;t we here to be tested? It ties back into the OODA loop, and the near-constant reaction to changing conditions. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t hyperbole when we were cautioned, on Day 1, that things move quickly around here. </p>
<p>First hackathon this weekend. In my first sit-down with Jessica, of Career Services, she noted that the final presentation for Career Day is like the first step in a job interview. This hackathon will be good practice in pitching, working as part of a team, learning about scope, and presenting.</p>
<p>Conqueror: `def show` as a critical requirement, only two breakfast tacos for lunch, only 24 hours in a day, congestion of every stripe</p>
<p>Conquered: writing reviews for parks in which I have rucked in a web app I built in Rails, learning more about Git, replacing defective shoe plate for cycling</p>
