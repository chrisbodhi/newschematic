<p>Day 4 at MakerSquare.</p>
<p>Started with explanations of why and how things happen here, which is always awesome. I like to understand thought processes and how decisions are made, especially related to design [speaking in the broadest sense of the word].</p>
<p>We were reminded of the Three Pillars to be instilled in us: teamwork, independence, and a love of problem solving. All noble qualities. This reminds me - I need to see if there&rsquo;s a Twitter account that automatically sends out quotes from Stoic philosphers. If not, well, I&rsquo;ll add it to the to-do list.</p>
<p>[Blast. Lost 20 minutes looking for Twitter accounts.]</p>
<p>Anyway, front-end. Introduction to Bootstrap and Foundation: Mind. Blown. In my earlier self-education, I had come across frameworks and dismissed them as convoluted and less hardcore than hand-coding CSS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fool.</p>
<p>After lunch, we had our first MakerStory, courtesy of Stu Smith of Sputnik Creative. It was great to hear about his start from an artist to a designer to a creative director, and helpful to hear about how developers and artists can better work together. It&rsquo;s at this point that I&rsquo;m very glad that I have that experience from the ETC under my belt.</p>
<p>Back-end: Ruby is the nil machine. We spent time learning about classes and staring at instances and instance variables. Deciphering cryptic error messages is a special kind of puzzle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to see that there are multiple ways to accomplish the same task in Ruby, but it&rsquo;s quite another to see how using the send method and passing in symbols as arguments is the same as using those symbols as methods themselves. Madness.</p>
<p>Wrapped up the day with my first weekly meeting with Matt. I&rsquo;m looking forward to bringing him questions as the weeks go on, but now it&rsquo;s time to follow the advice he gave me: sleep.</p>
<p>Conquerors: laptop randomly dropping wireless signal during the day, rush hour traffic</p>
<p>Conquered: A.M. pull-ups, sending a birthday card to my grandmother, non-sarcastic Twitter conversations</p>
