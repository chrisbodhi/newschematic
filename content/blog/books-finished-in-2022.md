Clearly, not much time carved out for reading in the last year! However, I was proud that I finished _Postcapitalism_ because I had started it in 2019; it was a fixture on my nightstand for years. I was wrong to judge _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ based on the title, but a more descriptive one could have been _How to Get Along with People in Business and in Life_. Burke continues to make me want to visit Montana with his paintings of sweeping vistas and rich sunsets, but that isn't the point he's trying to make when describing vicious acts of violence.
