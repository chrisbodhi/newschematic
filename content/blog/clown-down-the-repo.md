<p>Day 14 of MakerSquare.</p>
<p>All Rails, all day. </p>
<p>Routes, parameters, controllers. The diagram was just a stack of blocks at first, but once we started getting into building things, the language of Rails became natural. Well, maybe not <em>natural</em>, but familiar. Ish.</p>
<p>We built a YouTube-style video-viewing site, cleverly called MeTube. Initial impressions: lots of capacity to do lots of things, but wow, gotta keep those naming conventions organized. [Note to self: invest in Post-It notes] We worked with hard-coding information into the site, then moved to passing in parameters through the URL - both query strings and dynamic segments. </p>
<p>As someone said to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting all of this, but maybe that&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo; Shared a good laugh at that, but there was truth in it. I think because we got a solid foundation in Ruby and spent so much time drilling in classes and instances and namespacing [and many other things], Rails really clicked for us.</p>
<p>Fast forward to tomorrow, which will find me staring at my monitor and drooling on myself as I attempt to comprehend the next bit of the lesson.</p>
<p>Conquered: allergies I think, old iPod stolen out of car, writing html.rb not html.erb </p>
<p>Conquerors: replacement laptop battery from the fine folks at Bay Valley Parts, completing extensions for the classwork, using &rsquo;+&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;%20&rsquo; for spaces in URLs</p>
