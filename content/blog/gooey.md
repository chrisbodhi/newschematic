# Gooey, 1966 &mdash; 2024

"Dude, you gotta try out this AI shit. Man, it's so wild that I can..." He's started into his schpeel again, and I'm waiting for him to say "Kubernetes." Gooey loves AI and he loves Kubernetes and now he's dead and now he loved AI and he loved Kubernetes and he will never love anything else again because he's dead.

I didn't get what he was saying about AI until three or four months after he died. I heard his spark when he talked about it, but it didn't mean anything to me. How many posts had scrolled by my eyes where some text from some stranger extolled the world-changing benefits of AI? Thousands, easily. And here was Gooey, in a Google Meet, calling from a basement aparment in New Jersey, telling me the same thing. It hit the same chord as all of those posts, and it felt flat.

What I had failed to appreciate, what I think that many, many people have failed to appreciate, is that *the* moment when this all clicks for someone is unique to the person and their context and their exploration. For me, it was when I was chatting with Claude, trying to get it to debug ----- . It was an individual epiphany, a tiny religious awakeneing, satori without the master whacking me in the head with a stick, but rather revealing to me the path forward by watching this tool reach out to other tools to fix itself and then share the knowledge outward; undoutedly to be absorbed into the neurons of the next training session.
