<p>Day Two at MakerSquare.</p>
<p>First full day of class.</p>
<p>Front end in the morning: Mostly stretching the HTML/CSS muscles and practicing pair programming. Realized that <strong>float:left</strong> and <strong>float:right</strong> size the element down to the width of the child element - light bulb!</p>
<p>Starting to scratch the surface of best practices, from using &ldquo;-u&rdquo; in the initial git push to writing in the present tense for git messages. And, enjoyably, making the Sublime Text experience even more awesome by tweaking settings and learning shortcuts.</p>
<p>Back end in the afternoon: Mostly Ruby review, although at one point I had an existential ruby question. &ldquo;I see that the each method returns the unmodified array, but <em>why</em> does it do that? What is its reason for existing?&rdquo; Got some solid responses on how .each works, but I may need to do some more digging on this.</p>
<p>Second day of bike commuting in a couple of years. Nice to get out and spin. Might need to start doing yoga to stay loose.</p>
