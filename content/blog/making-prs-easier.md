For saving screenshots to the clipboard, I hit cmd + shift + 4 and then in the Touch Bar, there's an option to "Save to" that changes where the images are saved to. Select "clipboard" and that'll be the default from now on. There's also a more convoluted way to do it, involving holding down one more key, but those three keys seem to be quite enough for my hands.
