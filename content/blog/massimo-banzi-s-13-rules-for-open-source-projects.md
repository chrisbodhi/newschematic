<blockquote>
<p>Adapted from a talk by Massimo Banzi, co-founder of Arduino, presented at World Maker Faire 2011 in New York.

</p>
<p>1. Don’t make something you don’t use yourself.

</p>
<p>2. Know who you are making it for.

</p>
<p>3. Know what you want out of it.

</p>
<p>4. Make projects, not platforms.

</p>
<p>5. Respect the intelligence of the beginner.

</p>
<p>6. Experts are not the best advisors when you want to make tools for beginners.

</p>
<p>7. If nobody complains you’re doing something wrong.

</p>
<p>8. Including people is hard (but necessary)

</p>
<p>9. Good hardware, good software, good explanations, and generous users make a great project

</p>
<p>10. If you’re not prepared to have someone adapt, improve, clone, or trash your work, don’t share it.

</p>
<p>11. Open source software doesn’t necessarily translate into a business model… open source hardware must.

</p>
<p>12. Expect resistance… and conspiracy theories.

</p>
<p>13. Don’t let the fact that you don’t know what you’re doing stop you.</p>
