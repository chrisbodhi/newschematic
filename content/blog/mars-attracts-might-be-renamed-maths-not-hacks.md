<p>Day 33 of MakerSquare. </p>
<p>Morning lesson was on algorithms and using Big O notation to note how long they should take to run. The basis for the lesson came from a co-founder&rsquo;s conversation with a Google recruiter and her suggestions for what we should know for technical interviews. I enjoyed the lesson because ti was stretching a different, but parallel, part of the brain. </p>
<p>Afternoon was project work. We worked on figuring out where our hackathon project had holes and how to patch them. I added dropdown menus that populate from the database. It works for now, but it looks like we&rsquo;ll be restructuring our models &amp; it probably won&rsquo;t work tomorrow. Probably means it&rsquo;s time to start writing tests.</p>
<p>Morning class and afternoon projects will be the pattern for the rest of the week. Mars Attracts v0.2&rsquo;s backend will be ready by Friday so we can spend a lot of time making it real purty. </p>
<p>Not directly related: replaced drivetrain parts on my bike today, which was rad, but I found out tonight that <a href="https://goruck.com/heavy" target="_blank">my Valentine&rsquo;s Day plan</a> will start out with two minute maximum push-ups, two minutes maximum sit-ups, and a 12-mile ruck, all before a 24-hour team-based event designed to break us down as individuals, build us up a unit, and show us that our limits are meaningless. Should be lovely.  </p>
