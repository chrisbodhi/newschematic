<p>Day 6 at MakerSquare.</p>
<p>Week 2. This time, I&rsquo;m in a new building, which is really the old building. The atmosphere is different, but that might just be the absence of glass walls and paint fumes.</p>
<p>Upsides: standing desk and a coffee maker.<br/>Downsides: one bathroom for 20+ dudes and too much coffee.</p>
<p>Back-end now happens in the morning, which is the opposite of last week. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s better or worse [but it&rsquo;s probably neither - &ldquo;Man is disturbed not by things, but by the views he takes of them&rdquo;]. Dug deep into Ruby classes with my new pair. Seeing as I&rsquo;m writing this after catching up on the morning&rsquo;s work [at 2245], maybe we dug too deep. If we hadn&rsquo;t though, I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned that the &lsquo;puts&rsquo; method looks for a custom 'to_s&rsquo; method in classes, and print that output as opposed to the unreadable-by-human object! My notes from that moment read as, &ldquo;implicit class methods to make objects readable?! mind blown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had another MakerStory, this time from Josh Kerr, a serial entrepreneur, angel investor, and developer/startup fellow. Here&rsquo;s a video of him smashing a fax machine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure this dude has tons more interesting stories to tell, and will have many more to share in the future as his company grows.</p>
<p>Front-end: Introduction to Javascript. Introduced to variable assignment trickery. Protip: drawing things and scribbling notes helps focus the mind. Don&rsquo;t know why or how, though that&rsquo;s for a neuroscience/pedagogy bootcamp. Wrote some horrendous-looking code for a restaurant reservation system, but it worked and that&rsquo;s Step One.</p>
<p>Conquerors: still no laptop battery, running out of coffee at home, Ruby exercise about Power Rangers to knock out before class</p>
<p>Conquered: remembering that feeling of drafting buses on a bicycle, getting better at explaining coding concepts that I&rsquo;m grokking, finding new sludge metal bands on YouTube</p>
