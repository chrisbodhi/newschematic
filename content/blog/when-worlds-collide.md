<p>Day 30 of MakerSquare. </p>

<p>Front-end: We covered a couple of topics today. First, we worked with a weather API to pull a JSON object using AJAX within a JavaScript tag. APIs are powerful tools, but as we saw earlier in the program when GitHub changed theirs, too fragile. Maybe APIs need a versioning system and/or a way to allow developers to test their code against updated APIs to ensure the new release doesn&rsquo;t break stuff. </p>

<p>We then moved to combining the code from a riot.js application with Rails. Worlds collided. White space was blown away, folders were deleted, monolith files created, &amp; chaos ensued. But in short order, the app was successfully transferred and worked as intended. </p>

<p>Back-end: Debugging Rails. While I was familiar with the general process from finding (so, so many) bugs in my own projects, I was reminded of details I need to watch, specifically the pluralization of resources in the routes file.</p>
