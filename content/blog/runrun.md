<p>Day 20 of MakerSquare. </p>
<p>Frontend: <em>Inception</em> references to describe variable scope! Yes! Got my first look at riot.js, which deserves a closer &amp; more in-depth look. Secret for the day: we&rsquo;ve always been in the window object in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Backend: More work with associations and references. Finagled some Haml and even got it to [eventually] do what I want. Learned a few tricks, like <em>reload!</em> in the Rails console to process any changes. </p>
<p>Short one for today: <strike>catching up on sleep</strike> <strike>catching up on coding</strike> going to the holiday party.</p>
<p>Hope we eventually get a quick lesson in three.js:</p>
