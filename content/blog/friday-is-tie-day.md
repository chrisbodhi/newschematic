<p>Day 18 of MakerSquare.</p>
<p>All sorts of things going on today, with a half-hour delay due to the weather. Practiced using Git in new ways to collaborate in preparation for the hackathon. In the afternoon, we used YouTube&rsquo;s API to populate fields in our MyTube web application just based on the video&rsquo;s ID.</p>
<p>And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, we watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glii-kazad8" target="_blank">this video</a> on the projector.</p>
<p>Instead of starting to wind down at 4 pm today, we instead started our first hackathon. My group, Team CEE Low [it&rsquo;s an acronym thing], is working on Text-spiration, a service from which people receive inspirational text messages daily. Users will be able to select from a category of messages and a time of day to receive said message.Everything on the backend seemed cut-and-dry, but after we got to work following dinner, things didn&rsquo;t look so clear. It probably won&rsquo;t be easy, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to doing what I signed up for: building stuff. </p>
<p>Check this space for sporadic messages from the trenches and tune in on Monday night for a recap.</p>
