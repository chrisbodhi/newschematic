<p>Day One at MakerSquare.</p>
<p>Half day, on account of the Veteran&rsquo;s Day parade, which I sadly missed. Heard that the oldest surviving WWII vet was there. <span>Richard Overton. 107 years old. From Bastrop County, Texas, born in 1906. From the Great War to the Depression to the Pacific Theater to television to the civil rights movement to a man on the moon to Watergate to the oil crisis to the moral majority to the dot com era to 9/11 to a persistent world wide web to the recession to the present day. </span></p>
<p><span>It&rsquo;s enormous, the changes that have happened since he was born.</span></p>
<p><span>Our cohort is larger than I expected, but then again, there&rsquo;s more space than I expected, so it should work out. In my experience, it&rsquo;s unique to meet so many people so excited about the pursuit of knowledge. It sounds like hyperbole, but it&rsquo;s the reality in those rooms on Congress and at Brazos.</span></p>
<p>Topics covered today: forks, commits, and pulls on Github. Pair programming. Options at a local brewer&rsquo;s tasting room. Bicycling through strange streets in east Austin.</p>
