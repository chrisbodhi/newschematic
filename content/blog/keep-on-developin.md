<p>Day 34 of MakerSquare. </p>

<p>Morning was perhaps our last lesson on vanilla JavaScript. We learned about prototypes and the .call method. Unique about our preparation was that Gilbert had recorded a version of the lesson as a video for us to watch the night before. I felt that viewing the video and then sleeping really primed my brain for maximum absorption. Moral of the story? Take more naps. </p>

<p>Spent more time this afternoon on getting Mars Attracts to a solid place with the Rails portion. We&rsquo;re growing our databases and are not without pains. But we hammer down the errors as they pop up and keep on developin&rsquo;.</p>
