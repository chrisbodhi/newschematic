<p class="p1">Day 22 of MakerSquare. Friday is Tie Day.</p>
<p class="p1">Project/catch up day. In addition to working more with riot.js, I built a video playlist manager in Javascript. It&rsquo;s similar in style and functionality to what we had earlier built with Rails. I&rsquo;m curious about the advantages and disadvantages of using JS versus Rails for web applications. I imagine that considerations of scale and functionality may be factors.</p>
<p class="p1">Didn&rsquo;t get into much Rails work today but, wow, I watched a lot of the new videos from Ruby Conf 2013. Key takeaways from those: leave cryptography to the experts; I&rsquo;ll better understand garbage collection in the future; there&rsquo;s a wrapper for git for users of Github [conveniently called hub]; running Ruby on robots looks both easy and fun; and programs like MKS rule.</p>
<p class="p1">Also learned more about using git to switch branches [translation: looked up a command in the excellent Bohemian notebook and practiced it a few times]. Other tool work included going nuts with installing packages in Sublime Text. One of them broke my favorite shortcut, which is jumping between open tabs with the command key and a number key. I did come across this tip, which I&rsquo;ve been wondering about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&ldquo;You can type Ctrl+0 to focus on the side bar.</p>
<p class="p1">Then you&rsquo;ll be able to move selection among files with arrow keys and to open the selected file hitting Enter, without touching the mouse.&rdquo;</p>
