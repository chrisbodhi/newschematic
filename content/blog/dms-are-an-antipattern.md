tl;dr Continued DM's among individual team members serve only to further cement tribal knowledge, cut folks out of decision-making, and avoid embarrassment for not (yet) knowing something. The practice of direct messaging for non-sensitive discussions should be discouraged, in order to promote healthier teams

* * *

An all-too-common approach to communication I've seen over the last six-plus months is DM's for any number of subjects which should be public: how to set up a server, an architectural discussion, how to address an open PR. At best, they limit information sharing among the team members; at worst, they further fracture a team's cohesion and ruin any efficiency in communication by forcing folks to repeat themselves.


wtf jason and santiago, with that private discussion about what to do as a back-up for the first demo
