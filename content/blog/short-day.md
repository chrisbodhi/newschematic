<p>Introduction to Sinatra after building a reservation system with JavaScript. It was a half day and when I had an opportunity to get a ride home, a strange thing happened: I didn&rsquo;t jump at the opportunity. I had enjoyed experimenting and learning Sinatra, and wanted to keep going. Momentum is key in situations like this (cue a speech about inertia being synonymous with death, set to take place in two weeks). </p>

<p>Going dark until Monday. Remember that it could always be worse, and I&rsquo;ll be thankful every day that it&rsquo;s not.</p>
