Some parting thoughts: Not as many books finished this year compared [to the last](/blog/books-finished-in-2019/). I didn't read many graphic novels that I loved, and didn't finish any books in the months of April and August. The pandemic shut down my monthly graphic novel book club, it was easier to de-stress in front of the TV, and &mdash; probably the biggest factor &mdash; my wife gave birth to our first child at the very end of 2019. Having a newborn isn't great for reading (books for adults) or sleeping, but the rest of the experience makes up for it. This year, I want to focus on modeling good behaviors, so I'm going to make it a point to read more around the baby.
