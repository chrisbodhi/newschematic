<embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://assets.tumblr.com/swf/audio_player.swf?audio_file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tumblr.com%2Faudio_file%2Fcodeblocks%2F109808421585%2Ftumblr_nj43f1Zwo41smebte&color=FFFFFF" height="27" width="207" quality="best" wmode="opaque"></embed><br /><br /><p>I just started playing around with <a href="http://beatsdrummachine.com/" target="_blank">Beats</a>, a command-line drum machine installed as a Ruby gem. It accepts YAML and outputs .wav files like it&rsquo;s 1998.</p>

<p>As I started noodling around with the tutorial, I noticed that the feedback loop could be tighter. I&rsquo;m used to working with tools like <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch" target="_blank">grunt watch</a> at <a href="http://gamesalad.com" target="_blank">work</a>, and wanted a smoother flow. Rather than getting grunt running, I searched for some command-line solutions. This is what I found.</p>

<hr><h5>To watch for changes to the working YAML file and output an updated .wav file after each save</h5>

<p><code>fswatch -o path/to/beat1.yaml | xargs -n1 beats path/to/beat1.yaml path/to/beat1.wav</code></p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1515730/is-there-a-command-like-watch-or-inotifywait-on-the-mac" target="_blank">src</a></p>

<p>On a Mac, <code>brew install fswatch</code> will add the necessary utility, and the <code>beats</code> command is installed as part of <code>gem install beats</code>.</p>

<h5>To play the .wav file in a loop</h5>

<p><code>while :; do afplay path/to/beat1.wav; done</code></p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126667/repeat-a-song-in-afplay" target="_blank">src</a></p>

<p><code>afplay</code> is a utility that ships with OS X. And the rest of this is just some basic bash scripting; stop the infinte loop with the ever-useful <code>ctrl+c</code>.</p>

<hr><p>For now, you can enjoy (well, that might not be the word) my first go, for which I <a href="http://beatsdrummachine.com/tutorial/" target="_blank">followed the tutorial</a> and added samples without first listening to them. Can you tell?</p>

<p>And if you have any tips on how to DRY up some YAML, or even thoughts on writing some clean Ruby and outputting a YAML file to convert to beats, please share! Writing <code>XXXXXXXXXXXXX...|XXXXXXXXXXXXX...</code> again and again is making me sad on my insides.</p>
