<p>I had a dream the other night that I initialized a man with magnets in his hands.</p>
<p>Day 10 of MakerSquare.</p>
<p>Project Day is Friday is Tie Day. </p>
<p>Back-end: Working with tests and Rspec to build out a program to score a game of tennis, as described on the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataTennis" target="_blank">Coding Dojo</a>. Jammed up my Sublime Text&rsquo;s RubyTest package so I have to hop over to the terminal to run my tests like I was sort sort of prole. So, fixing that is going on my list for the weekend, right after I code up some deuce and advantage action.</p>
<p>Front-end: Fixing a tic-tac-toe game with JavaScript and jQuery. My initial patch penalized the player for accidentally clicking on a filled spot by skipping their turn - it was an accident, honest!</p>
<p>After that, wrapped up the Bowling kata from yesterday&rsquo;s Ruby class and added a test and method for testing a perfect game. In retrospect, it shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary, but it was good practice. </p>
<p>Homework and reflections this weekend, in addition to some rucking and maybe breaking ground, as it were, on a personal project. But first, there&rsquo;s a pancake special that is demanding my attention. </p>
