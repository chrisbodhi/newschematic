<p>Day 11 at MakerSquare.</p>
<p>Started the day with a motivational/direction-giving/advise-giving talk from a graduate of cohort #2, who two weeks out from graduating, has accepted an offer at a local company, which is sort of a big deal. The main bit of advice for us was that we should code, code, and code. And then code some more.</p>
<p>Front-end: Javascript objects look like hashes but they&rsquo;re not; they&rsquo;re objects. We saw something like this structure later in the day, which was a great way to reinforce it.</p>
<p>Lunchtime surprise: folks from Pebble came in to talk about their history, insights, and how they&rsquo;re moving into the future. I&rsquo;m looking forward to what they release in the way of software development tools and APIs.</p>
<p>Back-end: Getting into that stuff that I&rsquo;ve heard about but didn&rsquo;t know much about: JSON and REST. Wrote my first valid JSON, as <a href="http://jsonlint.com/" target="_blank">verified by JSONLint</a>. Puttering around with `makerblog.rb` and the CRUD abilities provided by the Unirest gem made the concept easy to grasp, at least easier than my earlier exposure to web apps through a MOOC. [Although if you want help from the gem, it&rsquo;s not there - docs are <a href="http://unirest.io/ruby.html" target="_blank">available at their site</a>.] </p>
<p>Conquerors: realizing where I went wrong with last week&rsquo;s project, first Javascript diagram of the week, putting on wet cycling clothes to go home</p>
<p>Conquered: learning about acronyms, second Javascript diagram of the week, a great burger at Hopgrain, first day of Stoic Week, riding in the cold rain, </p>
