Werner Herzog once laid out a set of rules for filmmaking. They were
practical, blunt, and shaped by decades of dragging cameras through jungles
and staring down erupting volcanoes. Here is what they look like adapted for
startups.

## 1. Always take the initiative

There is always a way. If you're waiting for permission, funding, or the
perfect moment, you've already lost. Build the first version yourself. Ship
before you're ready. The world does not hand you opportunities — you
manufacture them through relentless forward motion.

## 2. There is nothing wrong with spending a night in jail

Building something new means you will occasionally cross lines that polite
society has drawn. Not legal ones (get a good lawyer), but the ones that
say "that's not how it's done" or "you can't talk to customers that way."
If your startup has never made anyone uncomfortable, you are not pushing
hard enough.

## 3. Send out all your dogs and one might return with prey

Launch multiple experiments. Talk to more customers than you think you need
to. Try three pricing models instead of agonizing over one. Startups die
from indecision far more often than from making the wrong call. Volume of
attempts matters.

## 4. Never wallow in your troubles; despair must be kept private

Your team, your investors, and your customers need to see someone who
believes the mission is possible. That doesn't mean lying — it means
processing your doubt on your own time and showing up with clarity. Morale
is a resource, and the founder sets the exchange rate.

## 5. Learn to live with your mistakes

You will hire the wrong person. You will ship a broken feature. You will
spend three months building something nobody wants. The only fatal mistake
is the one you refuse to acknowledge and move past. Speed of recovery is
the real metric.

## 6. Expand your knowledge and understanding of music and literature

The best founders are not just domain experts — they are widely read,
deeply curious people. Read history, philosophy, and fiction. Study how
other fields solve problems. The insight that saves your company will
probably not come from a YC blog post.

## 7. That roll of unexposed film in your hand might be the last in existence

Treat your runway like it is the last money you will ever raise, because it
might be. Every dollar spent should earn its place. Frugality is not a
constraint — it is a creative force that drives better decisions.

## 8. There is never an excuse not to finish a film

There is never an excuse not to ship. Not "the market shifted," not "we
need one more feature," not "we're pivoting." Finishing is a discipline.
The startup that ships an imperfect product learns; the one that doesn't
ship learns nothing.

## 9. Carry bolt cutters everywhere

Bureaucracy, gatekeepers, and "processes" will try to slow you down. Carry
metaphorical bolt cutters. Find the shortcut. Skip the line. Email the CEO
directly. The rules are suggestions written by people who were not trying
to do what you are trying to do.

## 10. Thwart institutional cowardice

Large organizations optimize for not failing rather than for succeeding.
When you encounter a corporation, a regulator, or a partner who is moving
slowly out of fear, name it. Then route around it. Your advantage as a
startup is that you can act while others deliberate.

## 11. Ask for forgiveness, not permission

Ship the feature. Run the campaign. Make the partnership happen. If it
works, nobody will ask whether you had authorization. If it doesn't, the
cost of a small failure is trivial compared to the cost of never trying.

## 12. Take your fate into your own hands

No investor, advisor, or accelerator will care about your company as much
as you do. The cavalry is not coming. You are the cavalry. Act accordingly.

With thanks to Werner Herzog, whose [original rules](https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2011/10/31/werner-herzogs-advice-to-filmmakers/)
were written for filmmakers but belong to anyone stubborn enough to make
something real.
