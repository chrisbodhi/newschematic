![http://codeblocks.tumblr.com/post/67635706289/day-8-at-makersquare-came-across-this-image-and](https://68.media.tumblr.com/b83dc5b70b126037aa69c8102192db99/tumblr_mwllt4Ixfd1smebteo1_540.gif) <br /> <p>Day 8 at MakerSquare. </p>
<p>Came across this image and it&rsquo;s fairly representative of my learning experiences of the day, specifically the &ldquo;No&rdquo; and the choppiness.</p>
<p>Back-end: Introduction to rspec and test-/build-driven design. Follow along with the code during the lecture, take notes, work through the lesson. All good. Sit down to write my own tests and, well, see above image.</p>
<p>Front-end: More Javascript, specifically jQuery functions. Same story as the morning: follow along, take notes, work through the lesson, but sit down to do my own and &hellip;no. </p>
<p>In the evening, we had a lecture on providing business value using Ruby and Sinatra from some gents who work at Datafiniti. Props to them for coming in late and bringing up USAF Col. Boyd&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop" target="_blank">OODA loop</a>.</p>
<p>Conqueror: Rpsec, jQuery functions, plateaus, rooster tail [a.k.a. wet ass from cycling]</p>
<p>Conquered: finding a Ruby gem written by a dorm mate from undergrad, meeting a CMU alum briefly, getting lots of good points during a Q &amp; A</p>
