> Eventually working around high-productivity professionals like John Carmack made me realize that if you want to excel, then you have to work hard and focus the whole time.
>
>I remember Carmack talking about productivity measurement.  While working he would play a CD, and if he was not being productive, he'd pause the CD player.  This meant any time someone came into his office to ask him a question or he checked email he'd pause the CD player.  He'd then measure his output for the day by how many times he played the CD (or something like that -- maybe it was how far he got down into his CD stack).  I distinctly remember him saying "So if I get up to go to the bathroom, I pause the player".

>You know what's pretty hardcore?  Thinking that going to the bathroom is essentially the same as fucking off.
