>[Alias for my command line](https://gist.github.com/chrisbodhi/8151850) - Gist is a simple way to share snippets of text and code with others.

Listened to a Ruby Rogues episode on sharpening one&rsquo;s tools. Finally started to put together shortcuts for my command line. Thanks to Boggsy &amp; Mike for sharing how to get started over the MakerSquare mailing list.
