I'm an engineer who enjoys solving problems. Whether that challenge is a bug in a server-side module, or in figuring out a conversational interface, I relish opportunities to push myself while writing elegant, maintainable code.

Lately, I've been honing my JavaScript chops across the stack, applying concepts of functional programming to my work. I use the soft skills I developed studying writing and entertainment technology in daily interactions with folks from all backgrounds. In my free time, I attend graphic novel book clubs regularly, and work on expanding my physical capacity through powerlifting at my local gym.

Please donâ€™t ask me how much I bench.
