  - _Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach_, Kurose and Ross 
  - _Consider Phlebas_, Iain M. Banks
  - _The Power of Myth_, Joseph Campell with Bill Moyers [backburnered when the above became available]

Listening
  - Suggestions for an upcoming bug squash
  - Toddler at home while school is shut down

Making
  - Babies
  - Pacts

Meta
  - Living with both Obsidian and Zetteldeft (in Emacs) for note-taking (looking for a good org-mode parser)
