_This year's theme: On the lookout for knuckle-busters_

Knuckle-busters being those jammed up spots
that resist any movement, but block all progress.
Finally getting them unstuck stings for a moment,
but you get to move on. Sometimes, you even
figure out a new trick to try on the next
stuck thing.

**Consistently**

  - Three complete meals a day, protein and creatine supplement after exercise
  - Bedroom by 11pm
  - Dreaming of lifting while my shoulder heals; time to get back into running?
  - "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first." N.B. it helps to find the frogs the day before

  - _Make: Electronics_

**Listening**

  - Baby sighs while she's snoozing

**Making**

A steel thread to validate this idea: via web form, it's possible to specify parameters for an object (within a narrow range) and then download a generated STEP file of that object. The server and frontend is done, so I'm now learning CAD.
