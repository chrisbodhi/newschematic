_This year's theme: Just be good today_

Engineering software seniorly at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com) (acquired)

**Consistently**

  - Three complete meals a day, protein and creatine supplement after exercise
  - Bedroom by 10pm
  - Lifting: working toward a 135-pound overhead press by the end of the year
  - "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first." N.B. it helps to find the frogs the day before

**Reading**

  - _BOOM_, Hobart and Huber (leaning away from my compulsion to buy everything published by Stripe Press, but never finishing the books)

**Listening**

  - Baby sighs while she's snoozing
