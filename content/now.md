Learning about Networks during the third module of [Bradfield's Computer Science Intensive](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi)

From my notes: "To understand the what, why, and how of network _protocols_ is to understand _computer networking_."

  - _Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach_, Kurose and Ross 
  - _Consider Phlebas_, Iain M. Banks
  - _The Power of Myth_, Joseph Campell with Bill Moyers [backburnered when the above became available]

Listening
  - ["The Mess We're In"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4)

Making
  - Pacts
  - Plans

Meta
  - Living with both Obsidian and Zetteldeft (in Emacs) for note-taking (looking for a good org-mode parser)
  - Journaling with [Kurzgesagt](https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/collections/calendars-books/products/gratitude-journal?variant=32410837352496)
