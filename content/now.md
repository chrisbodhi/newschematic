_This year's theme: On the lookout for knuckle-busters_

but you get to move on. Sometimes, you even
figure out a new trick to try on the next
stuck thing.

  - "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first." N.B. it helps to find the frogs the day before
